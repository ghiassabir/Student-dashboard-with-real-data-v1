    "question_stem": "John is taking a rowboat both up and down a 16-kilometer length of a river. A constant current of 1 kilometer per hour makes his trip downstream faster than his trip upstream because he is moving with the current downstream and fighting against the current when traveling upstream. If a round-trip journey took him a total of 4 hours, and if he rowed at a constant pace the whole time, what is the rate in kilometers per hour, to the nearest tenth, at which John is rowing independent of the current?"
